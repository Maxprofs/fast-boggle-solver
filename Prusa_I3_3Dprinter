I went from a full time breaker to part time fixer. This talk is aimed at providing lessons learned and documenting the mindset changes I've made over the last year that I feel can be used by the industry as a whole. I've broken the lessons learned into three primary buckets; Red, Blue, and Purple and the talk will hopefully bring value to anyone working in their respective bucket or assist in their creation/continuing of purple teaming at their company.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Devops Days DC 2015: \"DevOoops and How I Hacked You\"** [(pdf)](/papers/devoops-devopsdaysdc.pdf) [(video)](https://vimeo.com/channels/carnal0wnage/138392795)  \r\nDescription: In a quest to move faster, organizations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them. Both Chris Gates and Ken Johnson will share their collaborative research into the technology driving DevOps as well as share their stories of what happens when these tools are used insecurely as well as when the tools are just insecure.\r\nTechnologies discussed will encompass AWS Technology, Chef, Puppet, Hudson/Jenkins, Vagrant, Kickstart and much, much more.

In a quest to move faster, organizations can end up creating security vulnerabilities using the tools and products meant to protect them.

amazing suggestions, and I thought I'd consolidate them here so they

This is not limited to sharing code by writing packages or gists on github. It's also as simple as sharing advice with new users, or being that new comer _asking_ for advice. It's taking the time to help a colleague write their first function, or pointing someone to a resource. 
Coleman (2012) notes that it is not a monolithic idaology in the hacker subculture exemplified by Debian. Nor is it in R. To quote Coleman,  _"Once we recognise the intimate connection between hacker ethics and liberal commitments *and* the diversity of ethical positions, it is clear that hackers provide less of a unitary and distinguishable ethical position, and more of a mosaic and interconnected, but at times divergent ethical principles."_

<p><strong>Shared identity:</strong> What makes a person a part of this developing subculture? I would posit it’s seeing a difference between R as <em>something you use</em> and R as <em>something you share</em>, in whatever format that is. There’s nothing wrong with seeing R in its intended purpose alone- just <em>using</em> is more than fine! But many people step beyond that and start <em>sharing</em>.</p>
